#First C++ project
<p>My project is about booking a ride, Firstly the Main menu will be presented on the screen which
includes Rider, Driver and Admin, to register yourself as a driver or a rider you need to provide your NIC
along with your phone number and email address, Limitation has been added that the phone number
must be of 11 digits and the CNIC number must be of 13 digits. After registering as a rider you need to
enter your pickup and drop off location and your estimated fare will be calculated accordingly through
the graph then the rider will be asked to enter the number of passengers, The car will be assigned to the
rider from the linked list according to the capacity that the rider has entered. The ride are then stored in
a linked list and if the user registers as a driver so the name is stored in the file while the user will be
asked to enter the phone number, CNIC and email address. After reading the file driver will be assigned
randomly to the rider, rider can also provide the feedback after availing the service. The admin can view
the records of Driver and Rider while the admin can also read the feedback given by the rider.</p>
